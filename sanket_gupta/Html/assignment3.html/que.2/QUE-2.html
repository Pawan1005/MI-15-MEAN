            <p>On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, 
                two self-proclaimed breakaway statelets in Donbas controlled by pro-Russian separatists.
               
                 The following day, the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force,
                  and Russian troops overtly entered both territories.[35] The invasion began on the morning of 24 February,[36] when Putin announced

                  a "special military operation" to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine. Minutes later, missiles and airstrikes hit across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, shortly followed by a large ground invasion from multiple directions.

                  Zelenskyy enacted martial law and a general mobilisation of all male Ukrainian citizens between 18 and5 60, who were banned from leaving the country.
                At the start of the invasion, Russian attacks were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk.During March, 
                the Russian advance towards Kyiv stalled. Amidst heavy losses and strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian troops retreated from Kyiv Oblast by 3 April. </p>
            <p>kraine says it is holding off Russian assault in key eastern city
                Ukrainian forces were successfully holding out against the assault in Sievierodonetsk, 
                the general staff said on Wednesday, while Russian troops were bringing in new resources towards Donbas in an intense battle 
                for control of the eastern region. 
                The days-long battle for the industrial city has emerged as pivotal, with Russia focusing its offensive might in the hope
                 of achieving one of its stated aims -
                 to fully capture surrounding Luhansk province on behalf of Russian-speaking separatists.

          <P>The most widespread religion in Russia is Russian Orthodox Christianity. The Orthodox faith is very strict. Upon entering a church, women must cover their hair, while men have to take off any headwear. 
              There are a number of rules on how to behave in church and the service itself also follows a strict order.</P>
