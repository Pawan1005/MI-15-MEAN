    <h1>Google</h1>
    <p><em>This article is about the company</em>.</p>
    <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
    <p class="para">The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.<br>
        <strong><em>Larry Page</em></strong> was considering Stanford for grad school and <strong><em>Sergey
                Brin</em></strong>, a student there, was assigned to show him around.
    </p>
    <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
        year they struck a <mark>partnership</mark>.<br>
        Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
        individual pages on the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide
                Web</a></strong> .<br><br>
        They called this search engine <mark style="background-color:rgb(58, 124, 195)"><em>Backrub</em></mark>.</p>
    <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;background-color:rgb(122, 121, 121)">

    <h2>Initial public offering</h2>
    <p>Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on 19th August 2004.<br>
        At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for <s>30</s> <u>20</u>
        years, until the year 2024.
